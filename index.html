            On a scale from 0 (I've never even seen HTML code) to 10
            (You know Facebook? I wrote that.), how confident are you
            in your web development skills?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I would say 6.5/10. I have some experience with web
            programming, but I would not consider myself good at it.
            Most of what I did was a long time ago.
        </p>

        <h3>What do you hope to learn from this class?</h3>
        <p>
            I hope I can acquire some more knowledge in web development.
            It is a subject that interests me a lot and I wish to maybe
            one day have a career in that field.
        </p>

        <h3>Have you signed up for Piazza?</h3>
        <p> 
            Yes I already have.

        <h3>Most Interesting Fact About Me:</h3>
        <p>
            The most interesting fact about me is probably that
            I am an international student. I am originally from
            Belgium. I came to the USA in 2016 to study Computer
            Science.
