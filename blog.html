				Four our first assignment we had to write an
				index page with information about us. I think
				it was a very easy assignment to start with. I
				knew the majority of what we saw in class
				already from before. So there was no real
				challenge for me. I just used my previous
				knowledge, and some googling to complete this
				assignment.

				For the assignment 2, we were provided with an
				already made html file and a mockup, and we had
				to do all the css ourselves. I already knew
				quite a bit about css from my past expaerience,
				but I still found this assignment challenging.
				I couldn't figure out how to align the filter
				from properly. After maybe three hours of
				googling and not finding anything satisfying, I
				decided to check on Piazza if someone had the
				same problem. I finally found out that the
				easiest way to make it work was to use
				flexboxes. So, the summary is that this
				assignment took way longer than I expected. But
				I enjoyed doing it nonetheless.
